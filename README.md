#  Oct 2020 Cohort Final Project

Pre-MVP

- Have user choose between three options of packages (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)

function buy500() {
    // user defined function (?) click button and display as total on cart
    getElementByID("something").innerHTML
}

function buy1000() {
    // user defined function (?) click button and display as total on cart
    getElementByID("something").innerHTML
}
function buy2000() {
    // user defined function (?) click button and display as total on cart
    getElementByID("something").innerHTML
}

- Price total will remain on screen but will change to whatever the user will click.
For example, a user can choose $2,000 priced package but can change to $1,000 package.

- Once user finalizes option, next step is to submit information in form fields.

- function submitNow() {
    // an alert message will appear after the user provides CC information and CVV code
    var "something2" = "Thank you....!"
    ...alert (?)

Post-MVP

- have ability to choose other products and create cart total that is more dynamic 
- User cannot press submit until all fields in credit card block are filled
